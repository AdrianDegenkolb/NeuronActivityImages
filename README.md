# Readme
This script creates an ensemble neurons. The amount of Neurons is dependent on the value of AMOUNT_OF_NEURONS. 
The Neurons in this ensemble have random tuning-curves if RANDOM_TUNING_CURVES == True. If RANDOM_TUNING_CURVES == false,
the tuning-curves are opposite (spike-behavior is inverted).
Afterwards it creates plots of the ensemble's neurons' tuning-curves, spike behavior and filtered output.
